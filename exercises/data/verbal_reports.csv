1,1,"B","With the first option, I almost certainly wouldn't win any money. Thus, I chose the second option, because the gain is higher. 
I also thought about the fact that 3 Euros isn't a lot of money to win (thus making the risk to take the first option more worth it) but it's enough for a coffee so it's enogh for me :))"
2,1,"A","- feeling in the mood to take risks 
- maybe winning 32 Euros but not losing any money if not is more intriguing and exciting than definitely winning 3 Euros "
3,1,"A","The option A presents a bigger gain. The gain of 3 euros in 100% seems insignificant to me, almost like no winning anything at all. "
4,1,"A","No risk no fun. 3 Euros are 3 Euros,but in the end they don't make a big difference. If I would win 32 Euros, I could go out for one dinner etc. - be more happy about it. It is worth the risk. "
1,2,"B","I don't like to take a lot of risks in a scenario where I can loose money. 90% risk of failing is just too high for me and 3 Euros isn't a lot of dept to pay."
2,2,"B","I don’t care about losing 3 Euros "
3,2,"B","I would prefer loosing 3 euros in 100% of cases, as it seems like a smaller loss. The loss of 32 euros even only in 32% of cases seems more stressful and more significant to me. Loosing 3 euros in 100% of cases gives me a bigger feeling of control over the situation like i am just making a choice to donate the money. "
4,2,"B","3 Euros don't hurt as much as 32 Euros. (nobody plays a lottery where you can just loose anyway) "
1,3,"B","The difference between winning 3 Euros and winning 4 Euros isn't big enough to motivate me to partake in a risk."
2,3,"A","gut feeling "
3,3,"B","I would prefer 3 euros in 100% chance as the difference between 3 and 4 seems minimal for me. In this case it would seem more “rational” and less stressful to settle on the potentially smaller win, but yet win. "
4,3,"B","If it just makes 1 Euros difference, I'll take the 100% win. "
1,4,"A","The difference between loosing 3 and 4 Euros is so small, that I'd like to take the chance of not loosing any money. Also, a 20% chance of winning is more favorable than a 10% chance."
2,4,"A","can’t really describe why it just feels „better“ "
3,4,"A","Here i would prefer A option, as the difference between the losses is small and it would not seem too sad to lose 4 euros instead of 3. The risk here is not stressful as i do not really care that much if i lose money or not. "
4,4,"A","Same like the last question, 1 Euros does not make a big difference. But with A I can hope of not loosing anything"
