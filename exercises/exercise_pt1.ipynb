    "## Using Notebook Environments\n",
    "1. To run a cell, press `shift + enter`. The notebook will execute the code in the cell and move to the next cell. If the cell contains a markdown cell (text only), it will render the markdown and move to the next cell.\n",
    "2. Since cells can be executed in any order and variables can be over-written, you may at some point feel that you have lost track of the state of your notebook. If this is the case, you can always restart the kernel by clicking Runtime in the menu bar (if you're using Colab) and selecting `Restart runtime`. This will clear all variables and outputs.\n",
    "3. The final variable in a cell will be printed on the screen. If you want to print multiple variables, use the `print()` function as usual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebook environments support code cells and markdown (text) cells. For the purposes of this workshop, markdown cells are used to provide high-level explanations of the code. More specific details are provided in the code cells themselves in the form of comments (lines beginning with `#`)"
